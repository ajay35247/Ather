## Hard Realities (deferred / rejected)

The following items from the original prompt are explicitly **not** in scope and will not be built without a dedicated safety, legal, and product review:

- AI digital twins / clones / "AI acts before user input" — consent + liability unsolved.
- "Self-evolving" autonomous A/B and feature launches — AI proposes, humans approve.
- Tokenized engagement / on-platform "AI investment income" — securities/gambling regulation.
- Shadow network building from non-users' contacts — violates GDPR/DPDP.
- "Personality preservation after death" — opt-in memorialization only, no generative impersonation.
- "200+ microservices from day one" — start with ~12, split when ownership/scale demands.
- Competing with Meta + Google + ByteDance simultaneously — pick one wedge, win it, expand.

      ads, the double-entry ledger, and partitioned analytics events
      (`infra/postgres/migrations/0003_monetization.sql`).

## Phase 4 acceptance (delivered)

      under `infra/helm/values/<service>.yaml` (37 files, all render via
      `helm template`); generic deploy workflow at
      `.github/workflows/deploy-services.yml` (gated on
      `vars.DEPLOY_ENABLED`).

## Phase 5 — deferred by policy

See [`docs/phase5-deferral.md`](./phase5-deferral.md). No code, no
service folders. The deferral is auditable and per-capability gated on:
documented threat model, regulatory sign-off, reversibility, operational
readiness, and validated user need.
